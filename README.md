# 🏥 Medical Insurance Price Prediction

This machine learning project predicts medical insurance charges based on user data such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The model is built using Linear Regression.

## 📁 Dataset Features
- `age`: Age of the person
- `sex`: Male or Female
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children/dependents
- `smoker`: Smoker or Non-smoker
- `region`: Geographic location
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Load dataset
2. Perform EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib
3. Handle categorical data using one-hot encoding
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate using R² Score and RMSE
7. Visualize actual vs predicted results

## 📈 Model Used
- Linear Regression (from scikit-learn)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## ✅ How to Run
1. Install required libraries from `requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `insurance_prediction.ipynb`
